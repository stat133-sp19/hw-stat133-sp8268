#### Notable Quote

> "We have not journeyed all this way across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy."

That's all I have to say about Yoda.

-------------

Here is a recipe for brown butter cookies. It is recommended you consume them in fall seasons. ![They look like this](cookie.png)

The actual recipe is available [here](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/12/brown-butter-brown-sugar-shorties/)

**Ingredients**

-   1.5 sticks butter
-   1/2 cup brown sugar
-   3 cups flour
-   2 T salt
-   1 t vanilla

**Tools**

-   Microwave
-   Spoon
-   Oven

**Instructions**

1.  First mix butter, sugar, and vanilla together
2.  Then *slowly* mix in flour and salt
3.  Roll the dough into a log and wrap it in parchment paper
4.  Chill for an hour
5.  Slice the log into (1/2)<sup>2</sup> inch logs
6.  Bake in 360˚F oven for 10-12 minutes

#### Euclidean Distance

The Euclidean distance between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\textbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>,..., p<sub>n</sub>) and q = (q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>,..., q<sub>n</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula

*d*(**p**, **q**) = *d*(**q**, **p**) $= \\sqrt{ (q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + {\\cdots} + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}$

$= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{n=1}^{n} (q\_i - p\_i)^2}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\\| \\mathbf{p} \\| = \\sqrt{(p\_1^2) + (p\_1^2) + {\\cdots} + (p\_1^2)} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p}{\\cdot}\\textbf{p}}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the origin of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.

The relationship between points **p** and **q** may involve a direction (for example, from **p** to **q**), so when it does, this relationship can itself be represented by a vector, given by

**q** **−** **p** = (*q*<sub>1</sub> − *p*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub> − *p*<sub>2</sub>, ⋯, *q*<sub>*n*</sub> − *p*<sub>*n*</sub>).

In a two- or three-dimensional space (n = 2, 3), this can be visually represented as an arrow from **p** to **q**. In any space it can be regarded as the position of q relative to p. It may also be called a displacement vector if **p** and **q** represent two positions of some moving point.

The Euclidean distance between **p** and **q** is just the Euclidean length of this displacement vector:

$\\| \\mathbf{q-p} \\| = \\sqrt{ (\\mathbf{q - p}) {\\cdot} (\\mathbf{q - p})}$

which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:

$\\| \\mathbf{q-p} \\| = \\sqrt{ \\| \\mathbf{p} \\|^2 + \\| \\mathbf{q} \\|^2 - 2\\mathbf{p} {\\cdot} \\mathbf{q}}$
